## Intro
An industrial-grade java implementation of RAFT consensus algorithm.
It's ported from baidu's open source project [braft](https://github.com/brpc/braft/) and optimized for java language/runtime

1. use [sofa-bolt](https://github.com/alipay/sofa-bolt) as RPC framework.
2. use [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb) as log storage.
3. use [disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor) for batch processing.

Also we implement some features that braft missing:

1. replication pipeline optimistic.
2. readIndex for linearizable read.
3. distributed embed KV storage engine.
